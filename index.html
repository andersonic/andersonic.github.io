			<h3>Hello World!</h3>
			<p>My name is Jun Ru Anderson. I'm a sophomore double majoring in math and computer science at Wellesley College. I'm a tutor for the Introduction to Computer Systems class and a research assistant in Professor Eni Mustafaraj's lab.<br><br>Outside of computer science, I love reading and writing. I've completed NaNoWriMo three times and participated in Camp Nanowrimo seven times. I also enjoy taking walks around Wellesley's Lake Waban.<br><br>

						<h1>Brown Datathon: DiscoveryInsights</h1>
						<p>
							For this project, I worked with a data set provided by DiscoveryEngine, a non-profit that allows laypeople to rate academic papers along three metrics. Datathon participants were given the opportunity to decide what direction to take; I chose to investigate potential bias in paper ratings based on the author’s perceived gender. Given the DOI of the paper and the user ratings for each metric, I used the crossref api to find the author's name, and passed it to genderize.io to guess the author's gender. With this information, I was able to separate paper's and use SciPy to perform T-tests. Happily, I found no significant difference in the ratings of papers by male, female, and indeterminate (e.x., only first initial given) authors.<br><br>Congratulations to Jong and Vaibhav, with whom I tied for first place.

						<h1>CS232-Artificial Intelligence: Pokémon AI</h1>
						<h4><a href="https://github.com/andersonic/cs232-final" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a></h4>
						<p>
							This project used Python to create a competitive Pokémon-playing agent. Pokémon is a stochastic game of asymmetrical knowledge, but most interestingly, has players choose actions at the same time (as opposed to chess or checkers, in which action choice is sequential). My team implemented three battling algorithms.<br><br>I implemented the random battling, whose performance was as poor as one would expect, and the expectimax algorithm, which peaked at ELO 1309 and had a GXE (expected long-term winrate) of 54.4% after 50 battles. I was also responsible for interfacing with the battle simulator, Pokémon Showdown, using the Selenium library.<br><br>Shoutouts to my partners, Dana and Hershel.

						CheckIn allows the user to set automated daily check-ins with aging friends or relatives, and alerts the user if the check-in goes unanswered. CheckIn uses Python and Swift, and incorporates CMU Sphinx speech-to-text, Amazon Alexa text-to-speech, the DropBox SDK, and the JSON library for Python.<br><br>Shoutouts to my teammates David, Declan and Eric, all of whom were essential to our team's winning Best Hardware Hack.

						<p>
							A text editor that provides support for enciphering and deciphering file contents according to a key/code. Implements a few vi-like keyboard commands. If quit through the supported keyboard command (as opposed to OS-level keyboard shortcuts such as Command-Q), contents will be enciphered before the file is saved if they are not enciphered when the user quits.<br><br>Credit and thanks to user Turk4n on Codecall for starter code related to the GUI.
